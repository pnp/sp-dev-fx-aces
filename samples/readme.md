# SharePoint FrameWork Adaptive Card Extension samples

Samples around the SharePoint Framework Adaptive Card Extensions to demonstrate different capabilities and possibilities on the framework. Each sample has its own dedicated readme file to explain the setup instructions and demonstrated capability.

You can head directly to the sample folders and start looking around if you'd like. But if you're looking for something specific, we've grouped our samples by card type. All the samples should start with BasicCard, ImageCard, or PrimaryTextCard.
