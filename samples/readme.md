# SharePoint FrameWork Adaptive Card Extension samples

Samples around the SharePoint Framework Adaptive Card Extensions to demonstrate different capabilities and possibilities on the framework. Each sample has it's own dedicated readme file to explain setup instructions and demonstrated capability.

You can head directly to the folders below and start looking around if you'd like. But if you're looking for something specific, we've grouped our samples by card type. All the samples should start with BasicCard, ImageCard, or PrimaryTextCard.
