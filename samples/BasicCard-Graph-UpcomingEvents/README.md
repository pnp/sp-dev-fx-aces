## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder

* If your SharePoint tenant does not already allow API access to the following Microsoft Graph permissions: Directory.Read.All, Calendars.Read then please follow the below instructions.
  - in the command line run:
    - `npm install`
    - `gulp build --ship`
    - `gulp bundle --ship`
    - `gulp package-solution --ship`
  - browse to your SharePoint app catalog and load the SPFX package. Once loaded you will need to browse to your SharePoint Admin Center and under advanced you will need to open Api Access and allow the requests for Microsoft Graph.
- If you have the APIs permissions already allowed you can follow the below steps.
  - in the command line run:
    - `npm install`
    - `gulp serve --nobrowser`
  - browse to your hosted workbench <https://YOURTENANT.sharepoint.com/sites/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx> and add the adaptive card extension.

## Features

This extension illustrates the following concepts:

- Using PnPJS to call Microsoft Graph to get the upcoming events for the current user.
- Iterate array content in an adaptive card.
- Slider property to adjust the number of days in advance the events it loads.
