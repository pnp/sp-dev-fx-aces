## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder
- in the command-line run:
  - **npm install**
- After that create the sppkg file using
  - **gulp bundle --ship**
  - **gulp package-solution --ship**
- Deploy the package to the app catalogue site in your tenant
- The solution needs `ServiceHealth.Read.All` permission of Microsoft Graph API. So, approve the API access request in the SharePoint admin center
- in the command-line run:
  - **gulp serve -l --nobrowser**
- or if using spfx-fast-serve, in the command-line run:
  - **npm run serve**
- Open the workbench page (<https://tenantname.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx>)
- Add the ACE to the page

## Features

This sample uses Microsoft Graph API to get service health data of the tenant. The value obtained from Graph is restructred using `loadash` - so that it can be easily displayed in adaptive cards.
