# News article content at a glance

## Summary

This sample shows how to build an ACE with multiple card views to show the first few sentences of an article in a SharePoint site, so that the article can be looked at a glance.

The idea is based off of the *At a glance* section of a news in the BBC news app (beta).

### Highlights

- Usage of `SPHttpClient` or `PnP JS`
- Conditional property enabling
- Usage of emojis in buttons
- Usage of regex to get the sentences from article content
