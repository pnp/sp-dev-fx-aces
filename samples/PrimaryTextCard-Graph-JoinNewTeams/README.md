## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder
- in the command-line run:
  - **npm install**
  - **gulp bundle --ship**
  - **gulp package-solution --ship**
- Deploy the package (new-teams-client-side-solution.sppkg) to the tenant app catalogue.
- The solution needs following Microsoft Graph API permissions. Approve the API access requests in the SharePoint admin center.

  | Permissions               |
  |---------------------------|
  | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All |
  | Group.Read.All            |

- Add the ACE **New Teams** to the Dashboard.
- Be sure to create a new Public Team if no new ones exist. Make sure you create the team with a user that isn't the user you are testing with as the user creating teh team is automatically added to the team as an owner.

## Features

This sample uses the Graph API to display recently created Teams (public ones) and allows the user join a specific team.
