# Weather ACE

## Summary

This Adaptive Card Extension allows users to search for and select a location to get information about its weather conditions, air quality, and health indices. The location and weather data is retrieved by using [Bing Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/?toc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fbingmaps%2Frest-services%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FBingMaps%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) and [Azure Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/about-azure-maps) REST API.
